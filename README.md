# Hugo Remark Themem
This is a simple theme for Hugo that is based on the [Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) presentation tool. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, and to make it easy to create presentations that look good.

## Installation
To install the theme, you need to clone the repository into your Hugo site's `themes` directory:

```bash
cd themes && git clone https://github.com/akhuang/remark-hugo themes/remark-hugo

```

Then, add the following line to your site's `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "remark-hugo"
```
## Acknowledgements
The theme is heavily inspired by yihui's blog and his xaringan theme, as well as gnab's remark theme. Special thanks to them.
